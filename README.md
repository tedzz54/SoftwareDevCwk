#This was a project written in Java within the Netbeans IDE.
#The purpose of this project was to create an application which would process data into graphs to that users could easily visualise it.
#The application only started with a massive excel file with data.
#This was a group project with 4 people. 
#Possibly not the latest updated version as this was done over an year ago.
